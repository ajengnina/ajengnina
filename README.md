# **👋 Hi, I'm Ajeng Nina Riski!** 

A passionate learner in Data Science and Machine Learning with a strong foundation in Python, data preprocessing, 
and model evaluation. I'm currently deepening my skills through hands-on projects, including data analysis, 
predictive modeling, image classification, and end-to-end data pipelines.
I enjoy solving real-world problems through data, and I’m especially interested in how technology can drive impactful 
decisions. My projects reflect not only technical proficiency, but also a commitment to clean code, documentation, and 
reproducibility.
